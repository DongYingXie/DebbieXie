	Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to Asia.[3] After water, it is the most widely consumed beverage in the world.[4] Some teas, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour, [5] while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes.

Tea originated in China as a medicinal drink.[6] It came to the West via Portuguese priests and merchants, introduced to it there during the 16th century.[7] Drinking tea became fashionable among Britons during the 17th century, who introduced the plant to their possessions in India to bypass a Chinese monopoly.[8]

The phrase herbal tea usually refers to infusions of fruit or herbs made without the tea plant, such as steeps of rosehip, chamomile, or rooibos. These are also known as tisanes or herbal infusions to distinguish them from "tea" as it is commonly construed.
